## Dataset

We will be using [Heart Disease Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) from UCI.

- [processed.cleveland.data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data)
- [processed.hungarian.data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.hungarian.data)

You **do not** need to download dataset. When the notebook runs, it will download the dataset into `data` folder. You may also use following code to download the dataset.

``` py
from data_prep import get_heart_disease_content
get_heart_disease_content()
```
